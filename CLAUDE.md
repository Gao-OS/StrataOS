# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

StrataOS is a new, layered operating system project. The repository is in its initial stage — architecture and source code are being established.

## Repository

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Gao-OS/StrataOS
- **Organization**: Gao-OS

## Development Setup

This is a freshly initialized repository. Build commands, test runners, and linting tools will be documented here as they are introduced.

## Architecture

*To be defined.* As the project takes shape, this section should describe the layered architecture, key subsystems, and how components interact.

## Conventions

- Commit messages should be concise and descriptive
- This CLAUDE.md should be kept up to date as the project evolves — add build commands, architecture notes, and conventions as they are established
